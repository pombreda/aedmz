// Package aedmz is an AppEngine abstraction layer to run a service

//
// This package contains code and interfaces to make it possible for a server
// to run on either AppEngine or as a local process. This permits not being
// locked in on AppEngine for a service coded using exclusively this package
// instead of using the "appengine" package directly.
